                <h3>Spider-Man</h3>
            </a>
            <p class="cptprice-disc">
                Spider-Man is a superhero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Created by
                writer-editor Stan Lee and artist Steve Ditko, he first appeared in the anthology comic book Amazing
                Fantasy #15 (August 1962) in the Silver Age of Comic Books. He has since been featured in films,
                television shows, video games, and plays. Spider-Man is the alias of Peter Parker, an orphan raised by
                his Aunt May and Uncle Ben in New York City after his parents Richard and Mary Parker died in a plane
                crash. Lee and Ditko had the character deal with the struggles of adolescence and financial issues and
                gave him many supporting characters, such as Flash Thompson, J. Jonah Jameson, and Harry Osborn;
                romantic interests Gwen Stacy, Mary Jane Watson, and the Black Cat; and foes such as Doctor Octopus, the
                Green Goblin, and Venom. In his origin story, he gets spider-related abilities from a bite from a
                radioactive spider; these include clinging to surfaces, superhuman strength and agility, and detecting
                danger with his "spider-sense." He also builds wrist-mounted "web-shooter" devices that shoot artificial
                spider webs of his own design.

                When Spider-Man first appeared in the early 1960s, teenagers in superhero comic books were usually
                relegated to the role of sidekick to the protagonist. The Spider-Man series broke ground by featuring
                Peter Parker, a high school student from Queens, New York, as Spider-Man's secret identity, whose
                "self-obsessions with rejection, inadequacy, and loneliness" were issues to which young readers could
                relate.[8] While Spider-Man had all the makings of a sidekick, unlike previous teen heroes such as Bucky
                and Robin, Spider-Man had no superhero mentor like Captain America and Batman; he thus had to learn for
                himself that "with great power there must also come great responsibility"â€”a line included in a text box
                in the final panel of the first Spider-Man story but later retroactively attributed to his guardian, his
                late Uncle Ben Parker.

            <h3><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hulk" target="_blank">Hulk</a>
            </h3>
            <p class="pubg-p">
                The Hulk is a fictional superhero appearing in publications by the American publisher Marvel Comics.
                Created by writer Stan Lee and artist Jack Kirby, the character first appeared in the debut issue of The
                Incredible Hulk (May 1962). In his comic book appearances, the character, who has dissociative identity
                disorder (DID), is primarily represented by the alter Hulk, a green-skinned, hulking and muscular
                humanoid possessing a limitless degree of physical strength, and the alter Dr. Robert Bruce Banner, a
                physically weak, socially withdrawn, and emotionally reserved physicist, both of whom typically resent
                each other.

                Following his accidental exposure to gamma rays while saving the life of Rick Jones during the
                detonation of an experimental bomb, Banner is physically transformed into the Hulk when subjected to
                emotional stress, at or against his will. This transformation often leads to destructive rampages and to
                conflicts that complicate Banner's civilian life. The Hulk's level of strength is normally conveyed as
                proportionate to his level of anger. Commonly portrayed as a raging savage, the Hulk has been
                represented with other alters, from a mindless, destructive force (War), to a brilliant warrior
                (World-Breaker), a self-hating protector (the Devil/Immortal), a genius scientist in his own right (Doc
                Green), and a gangster (Joe Fixit). It is later revealed Banner's DID formed from being abused by his
                father Brian as a child and that the alters known as Fixit and the Devil/Immortal Hulk originally
                manifested during his childhood, with a malevolent identity embodying his guilt, shame, and regret
                towards his father (based on him) manifesting as the Guilt.

            </h3>
            <p class="pubg-p">
                Thor Odinson or simply Thor, is a fictional character and superhero appearing in American comic
                books published by Marvel Comics. The character is based on the Norse deity of the same name, the
                Asgardian god of thunder whose enchanted hammer Mjolnir enables him to fly and manipulate weather,
                among his other superhuman attributes. A founding member of the superhero team the Avengers, Thor
                has a host of supporting characters and enemies.

                Debuting in the Silver Age of Comic Books, the character first appeared in Journey into Mystery #83
                (August 1962) and was created by artist Jack Kirby, writer Stan Lee, and scripter Larry Lieber. The
                character has starred in several ongoing series and limited series, and appears in all volumes of
                the Avengers series. The character has been used in Marvel Comics merchandise, animated television
                series, films, video games, clothing and toys.

                Chris Hemsworth portrays the character in several Marvel Cinematic Universe films: Thor (2011), The
                Avengers (2012), Thor: The Dark World (2013), Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015), Doctor Strange (2016,
                cameo), Thor: Ragnarok (2017), Avengers: Infinity War (2018), Avengers: Endgame (2019), and the
                upcoming Thor: Love and Thunder (2022). Alternative versions of the character appear in the Disney+
                series What If...? (2021).

                Thor placed 14th on IGN's list of "Top 100 Comic Book Heroes of All Time" in 2011,[2] and first in
                their list of "The Top 50 Avengers" in 2012.
