                <p class="cptprice-disc">
                    Iron Man is a superhero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The character
                    was co-created by writer and editor Stan Lee, developed by scripter Larry Lieber, and designed by
                    artists Don Heck and Jack Kirby. The character made his first appearance in Tales of Suspense #39
                    (cover dated March 1963), and received his own title in Iron Man #1 (May 1968). Also in 1963, the
                    character founded the Avengers alongside Thor, Ant-Man, Wasp and the Hulk.

                    A wealthy American business magnate, playboy, philanthropist, inventor and ingenious scientist,
                    Anthony Edward Stark suffers a severe chest injury during a kidnapping. When his captors attempt to
                    force him to build a weapon of mass destruction, he instead creates a mechanized suit of armor to
                    save his life and escape captivity. Later, Stark develops his suit, adding weapons and other
                    technological devices he designed through his company, Stark Industries. He uses the suit and
                    successive versions to protect the world as Iron Man. Although at first concealing his true
                    identity, Stark eventually publicly reveals himself to be Iron Man.

                    Initially, Iron Man was a vehicle for Stan Lee to explore Cold War themes, particularly the role of
                    American technology and industry in the fight against communism. Subsequent re-imaginings of Iron
                    Man have transitioned from Cold War motifs to contemporary matters of the time.[1]

                    Throughout most of the character's publication history, Iron Man has been a founding member of the
                    superhero team the Avengers and has been featured in several incarnations of his own various comic
                    book series. Iron Man has been adapted for several animated television shows and films. In the
                    Marvel Cinematic Universe, Tony Stark was portrayed by Robert Downey Jr. in the films Iron Man
                    (2008), The Incredible Hulk (2008), Iron Man 2 (2010), The Avengers (2012), Iron Man 3 (2013),
                    Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015), Captain America: Civil War (2016), Spider-Man: Homecoming (2017),
                    Avengers: Infinity War (2018), and Avengers: Endgame (2019), while Mick Wingert voiced the character
                    in the animated series What If...? (2021).

                    Iron Man was ranked 12th on IGN's "Top 100 Comic Book Heroes" in 2011[2] and third in their list of
                    "The Top 50 Avengers" in 2012.

                <p class="pubg-p">
                    Captain America is a superhero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Created
                    by cartoonists Joe Simon and Jack Kirby, the character first appeared in Captain America Comics #1
                    (cover dated March 1941) from Timely Comics, a predecessor of Marvel Comics. Captain America was
                    designed as a patriotic supersoldier who often fought the Axis powers of World War II and was Timely
                    Comics' most popular character during the wartime period. The popularity of superheroes waned
                    following the war, and the Captain America comic book was discontinued in 1950, with a short-lived
                    revival in 1953. Since Marvel Comics revived the character in 1964, Captain America has remained in
                    publication.

                    The character wears a costume bearing an American flag motif, and he utilizes a
                    nearly-indestructible shield that he throws as a projectile. Captain America is the alter ego of
                    Steve Rogers, a frail young artist enhanced to the peak of human perfection by an experimental
                    "super-soldier serum" after joining the military to aid the United States government's efforts in
                    World War II. Near the end of the war, he was trapped in ice and survived in suspended animation
                    until he was revived in modern times. Although Captain America often struggles to maintain his
                    ideals as a man out of his time, he remains a highly respected figure both with the American public
                    and in the superhero community, which includes becoming the long-time leader of the Avengers.
